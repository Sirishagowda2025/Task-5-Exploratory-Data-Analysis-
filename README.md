🚢 Titanic Survival Insights – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Internship Task 5
-

## 📍 Context

This repository is part of my Data Analyst Internship with a focus on applying real-world analytical techniques to classic datasets.  
**Task 5** was to perform a **detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the **Titanic dataset** to uncover patterns and insights that influenced passenger survival.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> "What factors contributed to a passenger's likelihood of survival on the Titanic?"

The Titanic dataset is not just about numbers—it's a historic tragedy with real people, and behind every row is a story. This EDA aims to dive into those stories, using data to explore **age**, **gender**, **class**, **embarkation**, and other factors that played a role in who lived and who didn’t.

## 📊 What I Did – Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. 📥 Data Loading & Initial Exploration
- Loaded data and explored structure, shape, and summary stats
- Understood feature descriptions and distribution of target variable `Survived`

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Identified and handled missing values:
  - Filled `Embarked` using mode
  - Dropped `Cabin` due to excessive nulls
  - Imputed `Age` using median
- Converted categorical data to numeric where necessary

### 3. 🔍 Univariate Analysis
- Studied distributions of single features like `Age`, `Sex`, `Fare`, and `Pclass`
- Used histograms, bar plots, and KDE plots

### 4. 🧩 Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- Explored relationships between multiple variables and survival
- Key Findings:
  - Women had a higher survival rate than men
  - Higher class passengers (`Pclass = 1`) had better survival odds
  - Children (<10 years) also had higher survival chances

### 5. 💡 Key Insights

| Factor |Influence on Survival |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Gender** | Female passengers had significantly higher survival |
| **Class** | First-class passengers had a survival advantage |
| **Age** | Children and young adults had a slightly better chance |
| **Embarked** | Port 'C' (Cherbourg) had more survivors proportionally |
| **Family Size** | Traveling with 1–3 relatives increased chances of survival |

## 🔮 Future Work – Machine Learning Extension

As a next step, I plan to apply classification models (like Logistic Regression or Random Forest) to predict survival using this dataset. This EDA project has helped me understand key features, which will directly feed into the ML model development.
I'm actively learning supervised ML techniques to build on this foundation.
